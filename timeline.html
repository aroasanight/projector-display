                <p>Finished off this timeline page - fixed spacings with the little timeline graphic down the left side, and copied all the contents out of the word document I'm currently making notes in and converted them to HTML for this page. From hereon out all updates will be pushed directly to this page instead of via a word document, which will be kinda nice.</p>

                <p>Created all the other pages for the different components - all with placeholder text currently, and started work on this timeline page. Had to cut off and not finish as much as I wanted to so I could turn my Mac off during a thunderstorm (am working on my mac mini instead of my laptop and it's not on a surge protected extension so better to be safe than sorry ig)</p>

                <p>Printed the parts I just modelled for the PSU and the IR reciever - have glued them on with hot glue currently but this will likely be temporary - you can see how "temporary" this ended up being by looking at the parts themselves to see if the hot glue is still there.<br><br>Proofread and adjusted the <a href="https://aroasanight.github.io/projector-display/optical-engine">optical engine</a> page, and also added more details to the <a href="https://aroasanight.github.io/projector">main page</a>.<br><br>Properly cleaned off the top panel, and mocked up the order I want to have the parts in vertically in the final product.</p>

                <p>Started work on this "website" - created the <a href="https://aroasanight.github.io/projector-display/optical-engine">optical engine page</a>, the <a href="https://aroasanight.github.io/projector-display">main page</a>, and also set the root <a href="https://aroasanight.github.io">aroasanight.github.io</a> page up to take stabs at people too lazy to type out the whole link :D<br><br>Removed casing from PSU to decide whether or not to leave it on in the final product - decided on leaving it off for more visibility. Measured and modelled standoff parts since the PSU is in two halves and without the casing they're loose. Done the same thing for the IR reciever at the bottom of the display - so you can see the reciever itself.</p>

                <p>Roughly reassembled and then disassembled the remaining parts back into its original projector form whilst recording - so that when I inevitably forget how things went together I can check back on a recording so that when it comes to designing and assembling the display, it's as accurate to the original as possible.</p>

                <p>Spent a stupid amount of time finding out some text to printo onto one of the pieces as a mini easter eff - I won't spoil it, but it's there somewhere :D<br>If you go looking for it, keep in mind that it will be visible without having to move any parts - so don't go bending things to try and find it as it's not worth it :,)</p>

                <p>Took the parts of the projector down into Tech block with Luke and spoken to Mr Weightman about actually putting it all together. He suggested looking at some existing similar things to get inspiration, which I will soon do - although I do already have a pretty solid idea of what I'm aiming for.</p>

                <p>Disassembled projector. This took a lot longer than you'd imagine (3 hours and 8 minutes to be precise) - partially because I spent a large amount of time trying to separate the top and bottom covers. In the end I got <a href="https://aroasanight.github.io/projector-display/assets/timeline/luke.mp4" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit">Luke</a> in and he just fully tore them apart with brute force - just to immediately after realise that there was a screw I hadn't spotted. You can see a white bit of plastic still attached to the top of the tallest support on the bottom piece because I just couldn't be bothered to remove it :,)<br><br>Also binned some parts I wouldn't need - such as a lot of shielding and casing, a few tiny circuit boards not worth writing about, and some wires.</p>
